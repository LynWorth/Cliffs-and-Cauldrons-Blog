# Cliffs and Cauldrons

This project is a blog platform inspired by Cornish witchcraft and pagan spirituality, offering a rich collection of blog posts that explore all things spiritual, witchy, and pagan themed. Visitors are welcome to freely browse through the site, choose which blog posts they'd like to read and then they are able to delve into various aspects of these traditions.

Registered users can enhance their experience further by contributing to the community through the comments section on each blog post, fostering discussion and connection.

Additionally, the platform features an "Events" page, where users can explore details about upcoming spiritual gatherings, workshops, and other related events.  

There is a contact me form for anyone who wishes to collaborate with maybe producing some blog content or they might have an event they'd like the site to advertise for them.
