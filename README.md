# Cliffs and Cauldrons

This project is a blog platform inspired by Cornish witchcraft and pagan spirituality, offering a rich collection of blog posts that explore all things spiritual, witchy, and pagan themed. Visitors are welcome to freely browse through the site, choose which blog posts they'd like to read and then they are able to delve into various aspects of these traditions.

Registered users can enhance their experience further by contributing to the community through the comments section on each blog post, fostering discussion and connection.

Additionally, the platform features an "Events" page, where users can explore details about upcoming spiritual gatherings, workshops, and other related events.  

There is a contact me form for anyone who wishes to collaborate with maybe producing some blog content or they might have an event they'd like the site to advertise for them.

## Fonts

Cinzel Decorative was selected for the headings as it evokes a sense of elegance combined with mysticism. With its inspiration pulling from classical Roman inscription, it perfectly portrays a magical, mystical and witchy mood on the Cliffs and Cauldrons Blog. Choosing to use the font in bold and uppercase along with its decorative flourishes provides a dramatic and striking effect for the blog.

In contrast, Merriweather is an elegant and highly readable serif font and was chosen to ensure the larger bodies of text are accessible and easy to read. Merriweather, placed alongside the dramatic Cinzel Decorative, provides a calmer, sophisticated text to calm the user, offering a modern yet timeless feel alongside the drama of Cinzel Decorative.


## Colour Scheme

### Primary Colours

The colour pallete was created in <a href=https://coolors.co/>Coolors.co</a> with a focus on earthy greens for grounding, earthiness and a calming feel. The pale green (#c5e8c8) is inviting, easy on the eyes and complimentary to the magical theme the blog sits in. Using dark green (#6a8e63) for the header and footer elements provides a strong contrast to the pale green background, reinforcing the nature theme and creating a cohesive colour scheme.
Gold (#d9a441) was selected to be used sparingly as an accent colour for hover effects, titles and  decorative elements. Providing a subtle glow that conveys a sense of alchemy, magic and sophistication. Gold aligns with the witchy mystical realm of spirituality and is perfectly placed within the blog to reinforce the witchy theme.

### Secondary Colours 

#ffffff to #f4f4f4 Gradient, a shiny white is used for the blog cards for a soft and shiny effect, providing a modern, clean and fresh appearance, allowing the blog posts to stand out from the pale green background.
Neutral gray (#333333) is useed for all other body text as a contrast, complimenting the greens and golds without overwhelming the overall design. 

All the colours have been inspired by the natural elements that surround us, greens for earth elements, gold for magic, mystery and spirituality. They strike a balance of being calming and soothing with some vibrant tones to promote a feeling of enchantment whilst also ensuring the site doesn't become garish and overwhelming.

## Conclusion

The choice of fonts and colours represents the theme of Cliffs and Cauldrons as a magical mystical, but earthly based grounded blog that maintains accessabilty, readability and a modern aesthetic. The font choices create a harmony of both drama and elegance whilst the nature inspired palette complements the chosen texts.




## Accessibility Considerations

I made sure that both text and background colours meet WCAG standards for contrast and readability issues.  Hover effects are subtle yet readable, using a colour change rather than underlines to improve the clarity of the text. Gold has been used sparingly with the knowledge that it could cause issues if there's not enouggh contrast against the backgrounds.
