# Cliffs and Cauldrons

This project is a blog platform inspired by Cornish witchcraft and pagan spirituality, offering a rich collection of blog posts that explore all things spiritual, witchy, and pagan themed. Visitors are welcome to freely browse through the site, choose which blog posts they'd like to read and then they are able to delve into various aspects of these traditions.

Registered users can enhance their experience further by contributing to the community through the comments section on each blog post, fostering discussion and connection.

Additionally, the platform features an "Events" page, where users can explore details about upcoming spiritual gatherings, workshops, and other related events.  

There is a contact me form for anyone who wishes to collaborate with maybe producing some blog content or they might have an event they'd like the site to advertise for them.

## Design 

Cinzel Decorative was selected for the headings as it evokes a sense of elegance combined with mysticism. With its inspiration pulling from classical Roman inscription, it perfectly portrays a magical, mystical and witchy mood on the Cliffs and Cauldrons Blog. Choosing to use the font in bold and uppercase along with its decorative flourishes provides a dramatic and striking effect for the blog.

In contrast, Merriweather is an elegant and highly readable serif font and was chosen to ensure the larger bodies of text are accessible and easy to read. Merriweather, placed alongside the dramatic Cinzel Decorative, provides a calmer, sophisticated text to calm the user, offering a modern yet timeless feel alongside the drama of Cinzel Decorative.
